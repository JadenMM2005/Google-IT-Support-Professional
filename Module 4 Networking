Networking is a super important and large field in IT. There are specialized jobs, college degree programs, and tons of literature dedicated entirely to networking. If you work in the IT field, it's super critical that you understand the fundamentals of networking. The Internet is composed of a massive network of satellites, cellular networks, and physical cables buried underneath the ground. We don't actually connect to the Internet directly. Instead, computers called servers connect directly to the Internet.
