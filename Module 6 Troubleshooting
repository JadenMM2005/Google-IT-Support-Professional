To excel in IT troubleshooting, avoid common pitfalls like going into autopilot and not identifying root causes. Autopilot can lead to sloppy work, so always gather data and carefully analyze the issue. Similarly, focus on finding the root cause instead of just fixing small, surface-level problems. Quick fixes like wiping a system may seem efficient but don't address the underlying issue or enhance your problem-solving skills. Investigating systematically and solving incrementally not only saves time but also empowers you as an IT professional.
